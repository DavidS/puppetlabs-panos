# Palo Alto Tutorials

There are two Palo Alto Tutorials available

1. [How to use the module with bolt](./01-using-with-bolt/README.md)
2. [How to use the module with puppet device](./02-using-with-puppet-device/README.md) which can be extended to get the module working with Puppet Enterprise.

We hope you enjoy these tutorials and find them useful. They should be straightforward to follow and are intended for new users. Feedback and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
