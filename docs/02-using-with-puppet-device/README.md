# Lab Overview

This lab will walk you through how to use the [Puppet Palo Alto firewall](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/panos) module with [puppet device](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/6.4/puppet_device.html). At the end of this lab you will have set up the module to work with `puppet device` for both getting and setting data. This can be easily extended to work with Puppet Enterprise using the [Device Manager](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/device_manager) module. This is a basic lab, no prior knowledge of either Panos or bolt is required.
